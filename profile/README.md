# Microservices-Demo-Projects with Kubernetes and SpringBoot / SpringCloud

In all the demo projects developed here the primary platform to deploy all the microservices will be **Kubernetes** and the primary framework that is used for creating the microservices will be **SpringBoot / SpringCloud**.
