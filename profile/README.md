# Microservices-Demo-Projects with Kubernetes and SpringBoot / SpringCloud

This organization explores the various **microservice architectures** and **cross-cutting concerns** by creating proof of concept or prototype/demo applications. In all the demo projects developed here the primary platform to deploy all the microservices will be **Kubernetes** and the primary framework that is used for creating the microservices will be **SpringBoot / SpringCloud**.
